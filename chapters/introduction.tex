If one correctly models the physical laws that are relevant at the mesoscale the macroscale properties should 

In this thesis the Voronoi tesselation is used to generate a microstructure which exihibit similar distribution in grain size as many polycrystalline materials. 
The generation of the tesselation and the meshing of it is done using thee open source program Neper.
 and mesh the resulting microstructure with a mesh conforming to the grain boundaries. A script was written to parse this mesh
 and insert new element between the grains. These elements are used to simulate the
