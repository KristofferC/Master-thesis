The aim of this thesis it to fdsfdsfs

In the first part  a
Five FE analyses were performed for cases were the cry
The results of these analyses showed a decrease in the variance of the stress response 
for analyses with increasing number of grains. An increase of the stress at the same strain could also
be seen for microstructures with higher number of grains. It is expected that this is related to 

The second part describes the method used in this thesis to include grain boundary mechanisms in the model.
In summary, this is achieved by inserting cohesive elements between the grains. These cohesive element models the
traction separation law that exist between these grains. FE analyses of 
FE analyses are then performed on Voronoi microstructures 

The thesis then
